# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Days 1-20: React + JS Algorithms and Data Structures

### Day 1: August 19th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on "React - The Complete Guide" & JS30: Day 17

**Thoughts:** I haven't been keeping up with JavaScript30 since Day 16 but I figured now is the best time to start it back up. I remember learning a good deal of small JS tricks that helped me with my portfolio.

I finished Day 17: Sort Without Articles and learned how to combine RegEx with sorting to eliminate articles when sorting and array of titles. I also learned that you can use sort to treat strings like numbers via the function (a, b) logic.

I completed only section 151, but it was pretty long and I was having compatibility issues with the old version of React the instructor was using. The main issue was the wrapper AUX function he decided to use which is deprecated now. Instead, I used fragments for wrapping instead and also included a return in the functional component.

Overall, today's JS30 was a nice little refresher on sorting functions and DOM manipulation. The debugging I had to do on my own was good practice for future React applications.

### Day 2: August 20th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30: Day 18

**Thoughts:** I never realized how useful .reduce() was! Apparently, if you want to use .map() and .filter() on the same dataset, it's better to pass the dataset through a .reduce() since it does the work once. That'd be great for speeding up a function! [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reduce-f47a7da511a9/) You can also tally items in an array or object, which would be good for any kind of object mapping. 

I learned how to flatten arrays with .reduce() in case there are no values inputted by the state in React. I also practiced nesting .map() functions inside each other in order to populate multiple arrays with different numbers of values per array.
