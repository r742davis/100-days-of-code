# 100 Days Of Code - Log ðŸ–¥

## Days 1-20: React + JS Algorithms and Data Structures

### Day 1: August 19th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on "React - The Complete Guide" & JS30: Day 17

**Thoughts:** I haven't been keeping up with JavaScript30 since Day 16 but I figured now is the best time to start it back up. I remember learning a good deal of small JS tricks that helped me with my portfolio.

I finished Day 17: Sort Without Articles and learned how to combine RegEx with sorting to eliminate articles when sorting and array of titles. I also learned that you can use sort to treat strings like numbers via the function (a, b) logic.

I completed only section 151, but it was pretty long and I was having compatibility issues with the old version of React the instructor was using. The main issue was the wrapper AUX function he decided to use which is deprecated now. Instead, I used fragments for wrapping instead and also included a return in the functional component.

Overall, today's JS30 was a nice little refresher on sorting functions and DOM manipulation. The debugging I had to do on my own was good practice for future React applications.

### Day 2: August 20th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30: Day 18

**Thoughts:** I never realized how useful .reduce() was! Apparently, if you want to use .map() and .filter() on the same dataset, it's better to pass the dataset through a .reduce() since it does the work once. That'd be great for speeding up a function! [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reduce-f47a7da511a9/) You can also tally items in an array or object, which would be good for any kind of object mapping. 

I learned how to flatten arrays with .reduce() in case there are no values inputted by the state in React. I also practiced nesting .map() functions inside each other in order to populate multiple arrays with different numbers of values per array.

### Day 3: August 21st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30: Day 19

**Thoughts:** Finished the Webcam JS30 challenge and played around with the rgb values. I completed the FreeCodeCamp basic dtaa structures section. I already knew the material, but it was a nice refresher because it's easy to forget some of the array functions. 

.unshift() adds items to beginning of array, .shift() removes items from beginning of array, .pop() removes items from end of array, and .push() adds items to the end of the array. Splice vs slice (adds vs removes)

Also, is it just me or is the spread operator (...) really fun to use? I love how versatile it is. You can basically do all of the same array functions with just the spread operator.

### Day 4: August 22nd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30: Day 20

**Thoughts:** Today was a light day overall. I am in the middle of job training for a side job as a server, so my time has been limited. I completed the speech detection JS30 challenge, which was really cool! I definitely want to integrate that functionality into my future apps since it's built right into JavaScript.

### Day 5: August 24th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30: Day 21 / Mug Club App Planning / Algorithm Practice

**Thoughts:** I had to skip Friday because of job training. Today will be a light day comprised of JS30 and translating some code notes into my Mug Club app. I figured out the preliminary data structure for the app, now I need to configure the backend to add the info to the user correctly. I also soldified a general frontend design which will undoubtedly change.

Instead of doing a short project Friday, I will do one on Sunday instead.

### Day 6: August 25th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30: Day 21 & 22 / React TCG Sections 160-165

**Thoughts:** Today was a late coding day, but I was still able to squeeze in some good coding sessions before I went to bed. My new work schedule has thrown me through a loop, but this is an opportunity to build my time management skills. It's also the perfect time to learn how to say no! I have a problem with overcommitting, so being able to manage this 100 Days of Code challenge with my coder job search, server job, instruction postion, and day to day life will be part of my overall growth as a programmer.

### Day 8: October 19th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Built CSS Animations and Algorithm Challenges

**Thoughts:** I took a hiatus from coding for a little bit to save my mental state. I felt like I was quickly losing enthusiasm and my progress was suffering as a result. I've been teaching online over these weeks, so I have been technically coding at least 3 times a week for the classes and the homework grading. I feel refreshed now, so I'm jumping back into the swing of things with some small CSS and algorithm challenges.
